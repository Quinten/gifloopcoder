<h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>
<p>Objects are created by calling various &quot;add&quot; methods on the <code>glc.renderList</code>, passing in a generic object with properties. All of the add methods can be called with no paramters or an empty object to create a default object of that type. The properties passed in override any defaults. Each object has its own specific properties that will define that object, such as, <code>x, y, radius</code>, etc. for a circle, or <code>x0, y0, x1, y1</code>, etc. for a line.</p>
<p>In addition, all objects can accept a number of &quot;style&quot; properties, such as <code>strokeStyle, fillStyle, lineWidth</code>, various shadow properties, etc. Of course, some of these style properties may not be applicable to a particular object, such as a fill style when drawing a line.</p>
<p>Read more about style properties in the <a href="#styles">Styles</a> section. This section will cover only object-specific properties.</p>
<p>All of the properties of all of the objects listed here, and all of the styles properties that can be defined on objects are animatable. It may seem unclear how you can animate a string of text or a boolean value. This is covered in detail in the <a href="properties">Property Types</a> section.</p>
<p>All of these add methods will return a reference to the object just created. This can be used to make this object the parent of other objects. More info on how to use parenting can be found in the <a href="tips.html#parent">Tips Section</a></p>

<figure>
<img src="images/2.3.gif" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>Because the container does not draw anything, any style properties will be ignored. The following properties can be used on a container. All of these properties are animatable.</p>

    colorRight: color.hsv(40, 1, 0.75),  // darker

<pre><code>glc.renderList.addOval(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This draws an oval using values <code>rx</code> and <code>ry</code> for the x and y radius. Because this is done using the arc command in HTML5, this object also draws oval-based arcs by setting the start and end angles.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2.22.gif" alt="" />
</figure>
<p>In addition to the standard style properties described in the next section, this method can accept the following properties. Defaults are listed in parentheses. All of these properties are animatable.</p>

<h3 id="path"><a name="path"></a>Path</h3>
<p>A path object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addPath(properties);</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>In addition to the standard style properties described in the next section, this method can accept the following properties. Defaults are listed in parentheses. All of these properties are animatable.</p>
<pre><code>path ([])           An array of points in the format [x0, y0, x1, y1, etc]
startPercent (0)    Drawing will start at the specified percent of the path.
endPercent (1)      Drawing will end at the specified percent of the path.</code></pre>
<p>The path can be an array of arrays, in which case it will animate between the two different paths. Ideally, the paths would have the same number of points. If not, glc will use the length of the shorter array, and excess points in the longer one will be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="poly"><a name="poly"></a>Poly</h3>
<p>A poly object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addPoly(properties);</code></pre>

<h3 id="rect"><a name="rect"></a>Rect</h3>
<p>A rect object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addRect(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This draws a rectangle. By default the x, y position represents the center of the rectangle. This also means the rectangle will pivot on its center if rotated. This can be changed with the <code>drawFromCenter</code> property. Setting this to false means the rectangle will be drawn from and pivot on the top left corner.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2.8.gif" alt="" />

<h3 id="ray"><a name="ray"></a>Ray</h3>
<p>A ray object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addRay(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This simply draws a line the same as the line object, but rather than specifying the line with x0, y0, x1, y1 properties, here you specify the starting point of the line, a length and an angle. You could do this with a line by manually calculating the end points. This just makes it easier.</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/2.16.gif" alt="" />
</figure>

rotation (0)        The rotation of the spiral. (degrees).
stroke (false)      Whether the object will be stroked.
fill (true)         Whether the object will be filled.</code></pre>

<h2 id="segment-objects"><a name="segments"></a>Segment Objects</h2>
<p>The next group of objects are special as they will animate even if you don't supply pairs of properties. They create a path - either a line, a curve, a bezier curve or an arc, and stroke a portion of that path on each frame. That segment will move along from the start of the path to the end of it, and then back again if you are in bounce mode. Looking at the examples below is the easiest way to understand it.</p>
<p>Each of the segment objects has a property that controls how long that segment will be. For the line segment, it's simply a length. For the arc segment, it's an arc angle in degrees. For the two types of curve segments, it's a percentage value. How this relates to the actual length of the segment compared to the length of the curve is complex. It's not actually a percentage of the length. The segment will be longer at the start and end of the curve and shorter in the center. But it is true that the higher the percent value, the longer the segment will be.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also animate any other properties of the arc objects the same way you can do with any other object. If done right, there are some great effects possible with these.</p>
<h3 id="segment"><a name="segment"></a>Segment</h3>
<p>A segment object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addSegment(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This creates a line using two points, but only draws a portion of that line. The drawn segment will animate from the beginning of the line to the end of it during the animation (and back to the beginning if mode = &quot;bounce&quot;).</p>

<h3 id="beziersegment"><a name="beziersegment"></a>BezierSegment</h3>
<p>A bezier segment object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addBezierSegment(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This creates a standard bezier curve using four points, but only draws a portion of that curve. The drawn segment will animate from the beginning of the curve to the end of it during the animation (and back to the beginning if mode = &quot;bounce&quot;).</p>

<p>A curve segment object is created with:</p>

<h3 id="ray-segment"><a name="raysegment"></a>Ray Segment</h3>
<p>A ray segment object is created with:</p>
<pre><code>glc.renderList.addRaySegment(properties);</code></pre>
<p>This simply draws a segment the same as the segment object, but rather than specifying the line with x0, y0, x1, y1 properties, here you specify the starting point of the line, a length and an angle. You could do this with a segment by manually calculating the end points. This just makes it easier.</p>
